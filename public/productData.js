Boasting a classic fish outline, Piseas offers a modern ride thanks to its contemporary rocker, updated fish rails, multi-fin set ups and a modified single-to-double concave bottom. The quad set up is my favorite, allowing you to surf more aggressively and confidently push into tighter turning arcs than traditional twin keels will allow. On the Piseas you'll surf better, faster and sharper.`,

        TYPE OF WAVES: Hollow reefs and long pointbreaks, optimal in head high and up to a few feet overhead.
        
        This user-friendly update to the classic fish outline has had some incredible results for my customers and teamriders. The Gen 2 Keel is a half inch wider than my SD Keel Fin except for the tail block—which is ½\” narrower. Narrowing the tail block added a bunch of curve behind the fins, which loosened up the overall performance characteristics and made it much easier than most fish on your backhand.`,

You tap into something different than the normal surfing experience. You slow down, feel the wave more, notice your surroundings in a new way, and really get back to what I like to think surfing was about early on in Hawaii. Gliders are not for everyone, but for those intrigued the path is a long one. And remember, with great power comes great responsibility…
